# Question 2 - Design Principles

**Figure 2/Figure 3** below are screenshots of the Energia website. Open the file [q2-design.md](q2-design.md).  Within this text document highlight **six** design principles utilised by the designers of this site to ensure a well-designed page. Include comments on text readability and layout patterns.

## Design Principles

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: The website uses a clear visual hierarchy to guide users' attention. The large, bold headlines at the top ("Get Our Cheapest Electricity") draw immediate focus, guiding users to the primary message of the page.

2. **Consistent Color Scheme**: The website employs a consistent color scheme, predominantly using purple and white. This consistency helps in creating a cohesive look and feel, making the site appear professional and polished.

3. **Effective Use of Imagery**: The use of imagery, such as wind turbines and community-related visuals, reinforces the brand's focus on sustainable energy. These images are relevant and help in visually communicating the brand's message.

4. **Text Readability**: The text is highly readable, with a good contrast between the text and background colors. The use of large, clear fonts ensures that the text is easy to read, which is crucial for effective communication.

5. **Whitespace**: The website uses ample whitespace to prevent clutter, making the content easy to navigate. Whitespace helps in breaking up the content, allowing users to process information more easily.

6. **Intuitive Layout**: The layout of the website follows a common pattern, with a clear navigation bar at the top, followed by a hero section, and then supporting content. This familiar layout pattern ensures that users can easily find the information they are looking for without confusion.

## Layout Patterns

The Energia website follows an **F-pattern** design. This pattern is evident from the way the content is structured:

- **Top-Left to Right Scanning**: Users first scan across the top section, focusing on the navigation and main headline.
- **Vertical Scanning Down the Left**: Afterward, they move down the left side, picking up key sections and subheadings.
- **Secondary Horizontal Scanning**: Users make shorter horizontal scans across important sections further down the page.

This F-pattern is typical for content-heavy pages like Energia's, where users seek information efficiently.

There's a hint of a **Z-pattern** in **Screen 1** (Figure 2) of the Energia website, which transitions into an **F-pattern** in **Screen 2** (Figure 3).

- **Screen 1 (Z-pattern)**: The userâ€™s eye might initially follow a Z-pattern starting from the top-left (logo), moving across the top (navigation and headline), then diagonally down to the call-to-action buttons ("Switch Now"), and finally across the bottom area of the hero section.

- **Screen 2 (F-pattern)**: As users scroll down into Screen 2, their scanning behavior transitions to an F-pattern. They begin with a horizontal scan of the main section and then move vertically down the left side, focusing on the images and text in the various content blocks, before making shorter horizontal scans across each section.

This shift from Z to F accommodates both a strong initial impact and more detailed content scanning as users move further down the page.

## User Type Focus

The Energia website subtly shifts focus between different customer types while maintaining a primary emphasis on home customers:

- **Secondary Top Menu (Screen 1)**: The secondary menu at the top provides options for different customer types, including "Business," "Home," and "Green Energy." This allows users to quickly navigate to the section relevant to their needs.

- **Primary Focus on Home Customers (Screen 2)**: As users scroll down to the main content, the page clearly focuses on home customers. The central content area features services and offers specifically targeted at residential users, such as smart energy options and community initiatives.

- **Discreet Secondary Navigation**: The secondary menu remains accessible but unobtrusive, allowing business customers or those interested in other services to navigate easily without detracting from the main focus on home energy solutions.

This design effectively balances the needs of different customer segments while keeping the primary content centered on home energy users.
